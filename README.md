Video conferencing with restricted remote access

This project aims to implement a video conferencing interface with restricted remote desktop control. Restricted control implies that a user in control of another user's system in the same video call will only be able to access applications that have been permitted be the user.

Currently, progress is being made to implement the basics of a video conferencing application which include basic video and audio control and switching video screens of different users. Once this is done, the remote access part will be built.
